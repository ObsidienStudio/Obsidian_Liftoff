The aim of this article is to give you details of the Hanzo project and its creation.

## Project history

First of all, a little background is in order.

The project was born in March 2021. Working in unenviable conditions at the time, I was looking for a way to satisfy my desire to create a game, and to mix it with a concrete project that was close to my heart.

So I thought of a role-playing game.

I've been interested in role-playing games for several years now, and in my spare time I've been creating games without beginning or end, where the rules were invented on the fly until they became tacit for the few players who shared them with me.

With the advent of online role-playing platforms such as roll20, I've taken up this approach, which I believe shows even greater ability to provide players with an element of context to create immersive games.

I therefore decided to implement a set of rules designed to be simpler, more affordable and more flexible than those of DnD5e.
Despite this, I've endeavored to keep one rule template so that you can easily switch from one system to another as you see fit.

So I designed the prototype for what would become a great adventure for me: Hanzo's Ruin.

## Game content

### Ninja class

This role-playing game features a ninja class that's been thought out and designed to be modular in order to match traditional role-playing archetypes while maintaining uniformity between characters.

As a strategic role-playing game, ninja techniques can be used in a wide range of combat configurations (increased mobility, camouflage layout or close-combat choices).

The use of elemental Jutsus also enables them to react quickly both in combat and on the realm's scenery.

Secret techniques let you play the famous 'manga protagonist' without taking advantage of the scenarium, giving each player a choice of spells rarely used by other shinobi.

### Archetypes, clans & secret techniques

The various archetypes are as follows:

* Master of Blades, specializing in ninja weaponry and exploiting surprise attacks, will always seek to gain an advantage over an opponent before attacking.
* Master of Ta√Øjutsu, a specialist in mixing, he has learned numerous techniques to use his chakra in his muscles. His stamina and power in combat make him a powerful ally.
* Chakra Masters, jutsu specialists with access to more chakra than other shinobi. They can manipulate the elements with precision.
* Master of a Thousand Objects, specializing in ninja inventions, they create their own gadgets and tools for adventuring in the kingdom. Their great invention allows them to improve a weapon of choice.

### Cards

I've also thought about a game map, fully modeled to avoid getting lost in the terrain or having extra content for game masters to manage.
\
So I set up 3 maps of 125x125 squares, giving a real impression of exploration and dense, living forests.

* The Cherry Forest, cradle of peace in the kingdom of Hanzo. Here you'll find a number of notable sites, including the 9 Wise Men and Hermit Hill.
* The Desecrated Forest, a dark forest where evil reigns in web-covered caverns. However, the presence of great spirits continues to fight against the corruption that reigns here.
* The forest of spirits, where the trees are so massive that you can walk on their branches. The cycle is disrupted here, and the dangers are great in this chakra-laden forest.

I then created a town, Xaen, which contains all kinds of merchants, still in 125x125, allowing you to move between buildings and have the organic construction of a hidden village.

A second, smaller village hides behind it, providing the city's inhabitants with a valuable rice farm.

I then created the missing elements: mountain, palace, spring lake... taking more care with map sizes.

While the forests are pleasantly large, the verticality of each map makes certain aspects of the journey unpleasant. The last maps, for example, are designed as a dungeon, a road and an arena.
