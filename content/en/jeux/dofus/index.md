Dofus what a crazy game

Seriously, this is a game I've underestimated for far too long.
At the time, dofus players were even laughed at, but today I can say that I've never been so wrong.

The game is an ode to MMO players, with rewards for the greatest grinders, a complete crafting system and a constant need for the community to be dynamic.

\
But it's also an RPG, with a characteristic system and a variety of spells allowing for numerous builds and team configurations (19 classes, that's a lot of group strategies).

\
And finally, tactical, because they've thought up so many strategies based on square combat. Their Action Point/Movement Point system gives you the greatest freedom in combat of any board game, and allows you to be more strategic and prepared than some action RPGs. Time becomes precious, as turns only last about ten seconds!

In Dofus, you play the role of a soul gifted with powers conferred by the gods themselves! \
Find the dofus and explore the world of the twelve! That's the simple but effective promise of Dofus.

The game is challenging, and its emphasis on boss strategies and quest battles rewards the most determined and cleverest.

While there's some smoothing out between classes on certain aspects (they can all use healing, for example), the feeling of having a unique gameplay is present every time, and the diversity of spells (30~) usable on each turn allows for unique or roundabout uses of many mechanics.
\
objectives are all attainable, but often with help. Many hours of farm and tryhard work will be needed to complete the quest sequences, which often offer great rewards for those with the patience.
