Today, Meridian Corp is a fast-growing group, but that wasn't always the case...

It all began in 2008 in a Battle.NET newsgroup set up by 3 fellow members and joined by a few fellow gamers.
At the time, the team had no name, and played mainly Overwatch.

The La Hype newsgroup was a first approach to a group on which we recruited a few companions as we went along. It was in this context that \*Stew, TosOp and Blazer-Scout joined the adventure.

La Hype" server description (...) :

> For 2 people:
> slice the pelo
> Place the pelo in a 200° oven for 10 min.
> Remove the pelo and turn it over so that it can brown.
> Serve the pelo in a soup plate with a white sauce (e.g. béarnaise).
> Bon pélo !

But this platform (Bnet) wasn't stable enough or adapted to our communication needs. It was impossible to transfer images, the conversation history was limited, and the chat channels were inaccessible at least once a week.

Obsidian proposed a (first) transition to discord, and created a rather shabby server to accommodate our heroes:

As the first discord server in our entourage, he was soon joined by GeneralPetitCornichon/Furibar and his troupe, and although we didn't always play the same game, they were already listening to what was going on at home.

It was in 2020, at the time of the Corona Virus crisis, that the server changed. Following altercations between members of the group, the server was no longer in use and didn't correspond to the space we needed to coexist without stepping on each other's toes.

Obsidian set up the "Meridian" server, which was intended to be a family server, but in a broader sense. Not just one household, but several, were set up on this server, which was far more developed than its predecessor.

A server on which we made a point of being the best versions of ourselves and welcoming new faces into the fold.

The server is now in full swing and has become a veritable den for us, combining a wide range of games with fascinating discussions.

After that, many players joined the adventure thanks to the wave of Among Us from the pandemic, the most notorious being Betamèche, Karmared, Selenyx and Seum.

It was after the pandemic that Obsidian, following all the encounters that had taken place on the discord, decided to turn Meridian into a community server, closed to no one and destined to be increasingly inhabited to develop more ambitious projects (Hanzo in his case).

Obsidian then asked all Meridian players to join it on a new server, designed with greater care and rules facilitating the management of more companions: Meridian Corp.
